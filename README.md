A collection of ideas on how to display many images to the user as fast as possible
</br></br>
Some ideas and their realizations of better ways to scroll through images for <a href="https://afterschoolapp.com/">After School App</a>. The goal is for the user to see and process as many images as possible in the fastest amount of time.
</br></br>
The code is not elegant or user friendly. In fact, some of it is horrible. But it compiles and everything works as intended.
</br></br>
Here are the methods contained:</br>
<ol>
<li>"Scale" - Pinch as images scale up on top of one another. Kind of feels like you're zooming through your camera roll</li>
<li>"Dynamic Rows" - Move your finger and two rows of images will move in oposite directions. This is one of my favorites</li>
<li>"Grid Tap Inverse" - See a grid of 4 images, and tap one to replace it with another</li>
<li>"Static Rows" - A double decker carousel of images that are loaded asynchronously for a buttery feel</li>
<li>"Stack" - Swipe down to see a new image. The image you were looking at moves down onto a stack of previously-viewed images and becomes transparent</li>
</ol>
</br></br>
I'm adding more as I come up with them.
